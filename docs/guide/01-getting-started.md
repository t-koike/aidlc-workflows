# Getting Started

This chapter walks you through installing this implementation, verifying your environment, and preparing for your first workflow.

---

## Prerequisites

Install the CLI harness you plan to use. The AI-DLC native installer supplies
the self-contained `aidlc` runtime; Bun is required only for framework source
development, the advanced `dist/<harness>/` copy channel, or a third-party
plugin that explicitly declares Bun-backed commands.

| Prerequisite | Purpose | Install |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | This implementation runs as a Claude Code command. The orchestrator, agents, and hooks all execute within Claude Code. | Native install (recommended, auto-updates): macOS/Linux/WSL `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh \| bash`; Windows PowerShell `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 \| iex`. Or `brew install --cask claude-code`. ([docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart)) |
| **AI-DLC** | Supplies the deterministic engine, hooks, and lifecycle command. | Installed in [Installation](#installation) below. |

Verify prerequisites:

```bash
command -v claude >/dev/null && echo "✓ Claude Code installed" || echo "✗ Install Claude Code first"
command -v aidlc  >/dev/null && echo "✓ AI-DLC installed"       || echo "✗ Install AI-DLC first"
```

## AWS Bedrock Setup

This implementation ships configured for **AWS Bedrock**. The shipped `.claude/settings.json` sets:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` | `1` | Routes Claude Code through Bedrock |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | Bedrock region — **required**; Claude Code does not read it from `~/.aws`. Override per-region (see below). |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-fable-5[1m]` | Fable alias for users who opt into `fable`/`fable[1m]` |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8[1m]` | Orchestrator model (used at `opus[1m]`, the 1M-context variant) |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6[1m]` | Subagent model |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` | Background/fast tasks (no `[1m]`: Haiku 4.5 is a 200K model with no 1M variant) |

These model pins use global Bedrock inference profile IDs (the `global.` prefix). The `[1m]` suffix on the Fable, Opus, and Sonnet pins selects the 1M-context variant — so tier-pinned subagents (not just the `opus[1m]` orchestrator) get the 1M window; Claude Code strips the suffix before the model ID reaches Bedrock. You still need to do the AWS-account-side setup once.

### One-time AWS account setup (manual path)

1. **Enable Anthropic model access.** In the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), open the **Model catalog**, select each Anthropic model you'll use (Fable, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku), and submit the use-case form. Access is granted immediately. This is required once per AWS account before any model can be invoked. (AWS Organizations can submit once from the management account; approval extends to child accounts.)

2. **Attach the IAM permissions** your role/user needs to invoke models and resolve inference profiles:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "AllowModelAndInferenceProfileAccess",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "bedrock:InvokeModel",
           "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream",
           "bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles",
           "bedrock:GetInferenceProfile"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:inference-profile/*",
           "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:application-inference-profile/*",
           "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:foundation-model/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Provide AWS credentials.** Claude Code uses the default AWS SDK credential chain. Any one of:

   ```bash
   aws configure                         # static access key / secret
   # — or — an SSO profile:
   aws sso login --profile <your-profile>
   export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>
   # — or — credentials already exported in your environment (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc.)
   ```

   Keep secrets out of the shared `settings.json`. Put `AWS_PROFILE` (or other env you don't want to leak) in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) instead.

4. **Set your region** if it isn't `us-east-1`. The shipped default is `us-east-1`; override it without editing shared config:

   ```bash
   cp .claude/settings.local.json.example .claude/settings.local.json
   # then add  "AWS_REGION": "<your-region>"  to the env block
   ```

   `settings.local.json` takes precedence over `settings.json`. Confirm the model is available in your region with `aws bedrock list-inference-profiles --region <your-region>`.

> **Easier path:** instead of the manual steps above, run `claude`, choose **3rd-party platform → Amazon Bedrock** at the login prompt, and the wizard detects your credentials, region, and accessible models and writes them to your user settings. Re-run `/setup-bedrock` any time to change them. You still complete step 1 (model access) once in the console.

For the authoritative, always-current setup — IAM detail, SSO refresh, inference profiles, troubleshooting — see the AWS guide: **[Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock: Quick Setup Guide](https://community.aws/content/2tXkZKrZzlrlu0KfH8gST5Dkppq/claude-code-on-amazon-bedrock-quick-setup-guide)** and the [Amazon Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).

## MCP Servers (optional)

This implementation declares its MCP servers in `.mcp.json` at the project root (beside `.claude/`). Claude Code provisions them to the session, and every AI-DLC agent inherits all of them — so any agent can reach any declared server with no per-agent grant. The shipped `.mcp.json` declares five MCP servers:

| Server | Provides | Transport | Credentials |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `context7` | Library/SDK documentation lookups | HTTP | `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` from your environment |
| `aws-mcp` | AWS API access | `uvx` (`mcp-proxy-for-aws@latest`, `AWS_REGION=us-east-1`) | Standard AWS credential chain |
| `aws-pricing` | AWS pricing queries | `uvx` (`awslabs.aws-pricing-mcp-server@latest`) | AWS credential chain |
| `aws-iac` | Infrastructure-as-code tooling | `uvx` (`awslabs.aws-iac-mcp-server@latest`) | AWS credential chain |
| `aws-serverless` | Serverless tooling | `uvx` (`awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server@latest`) | AWS credential chain |

### Prerequisites

The four AWS servers launch through `uvx`. Install `uv`/`uvx` once:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

`context7` is an HTTP server and needs no local install. To use it, export an API key:

```bash
export CONTEXT7_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

Put `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` (and any other secret env) in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) rather than the shared `settings.json`. `.mcp.json` itself carries only the env-var placeholder — no secrets are committed.

### What becomes available

The four AWS servers authenticate with the same default AWS SDK credential chain Claude Code already uses for Bedrock (see [AWS Bedrock Setup](#aws-bedrock-setup)). Once `uvx` is installed and AWS credentials resolve, those servers come up automatically; `context7` comes up once `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` is set. Because the servers are inherited at the session level, every agent reaches every declared server — there is no per-agent grant to perform.

> **Restricting an agent (advanced):** inheritance is additive — declaring a server makes it available to all agents, and you cannot grant servers per-agent. To *prevent* a specific agent from using a server, narrow that agent's `tools:` allowlist to the fully-qualified `mcp__<server>__<tool>` ids it may call (a bare `mcp__<server>` token is not honoured). See [Agents](06-agents.md) for how agent tool access works.

### Not using these?

Missing credentials are not blocking. A server you have no credentials for — no AWS chain, no `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` — is simply unavailable; the workflow runs without it and never stalls waiting on it. To drop a server entirely, remove its entry from `.mcp.json`.

---

## Installation

The native installer is the default. It installs a checksum-verified binary
and the selected harness runtime without Bun, Node.js, or Git:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- --harness claude
cd your-project
aidlc init --mcp none
aidlc doctor
```

Use `--harness kiro`, `kiro-ide`, `codex`, or `opencode` for another distribution.
`aidlc init --dry-run` previews project changes, and
`install.sh --from <release-directory> --offline --harness <name>` installs an
air-gapped package. Pass `--profile "$HOME/.profile"` only when the installer
should add its marked PATH block; profiles are never edited by default.

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP install-aidlc.ps1
irm https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 -OutFile $installer
& $installer -Harness claude
cd your-project
aidlc init --mcp none
aidlc doctor
```

The installer places a stable `aidlc.cmd` under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\aidlc\bin`, verifies the same release checksums, and supports
`-From <release-directory> -Offline` for an air-gapped package. It adds that
directory to the current PowerShell session and prints the exact command needed
in a new session when the directory is not already on `PATH`.
`AIDLC_OFFLINE=1` has the same effect as `-Offline` and requires `-From`, so it
cannot silently open a network connection.

The installer authenticates the release with SHA-256 checksums. Published
artifacts also carry SLSA provenance attestations; checksums, TLS, and
attestation are the permanent release trust model.

### Manual Projection

The committed `dist/<harness>/` trees remain available for source checkouts,
but they now invoke the installed native `aidlc` command. They are not a
standalone Bun installation. Install a matching binary first, then project the
local distribution through the same typed reconciliation used by the installer:

```bash
aidlc init --project-dir your-project --from "$PWD/dist/claude" --harness claude
```

This preserves project-owned root content and merges `.gitignore`, `.mcp.json`,
and `AGENTS.md` according to [Install and
Lifecycle](18-install-and-lifecycle.md#root-files-and-existing-projects).

---

## The Workspace Shell

`aidlc init` creates the workspace shell: the `.claude/` engine plus
`aidlc/spaces/default/` holding the memory layer
(`aidlc/spaces/default/memory/`, where team-affirmed practices and learnings
live). A complete manual projection already contains the same shell.

The first time you run `/aidlc` (or describe what to build), the engine
**auto-births** the first intent into the active space. Each intent gets its own
record dir at `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/`, which holds:

- `aidlc-state.md` — the per-intent workflow state
- `audit/` — the audit trail, written as per-clone shards (`<host>-<clone>.md`)
- `<phase>/<stage>/...` — the stage artifacts (e.g. `inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`)

Team knowledge lives one level up, at the space level —
`aidlc/spaces/<space>/knowledge/` (a sibling of `intents/`) — so it accumulates
across every intent in the space. The engine creates it empty; you add free-form
files under an optional `aidlc-shared/` and per-agent subdirectories.

To add [team knowledge](08-knowledge.md) or team practices before your first run,
edit the shipped `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` files; the space-level
`aidlc/knowledge/` directory is created (empty) once your first `/aidlc` runs.

Init also records a refresh baseline before the first harness session. It does
not create a workflow intent and never uses the network.

For the full picture of the workspace layout — how it holds many intents at once,
what spaces are for, and the commands to move between them — see
[Spaces and Intents](03-spaces-and-intents.md).

## Verify the Setup

Run the health check to confirm everything is in place:

```
/aidlc --doctor
```

`--doctor` exits 0 when every check passes and 1 when any check fails; the full report writes to stdout in both cases.

### What `--doctor` checks

| Check | What It Validates |
|-------|-------------------|
| Prerequisites | Active self-contained `aidlc` command |
| Installed runtime | Active machine version and selected harness runtime for binary installs |
| Project stamp | Project distribution/version compared with the selected engine |
| Hook presence | Every hook `settings.json` wires (its `hooks` blocks + the `statusLine` command — all 13 framework hooks) exists in `.claude/hooks/`; a wired-but-missing hook fails loudly. Sourcing the expected roster from `settings.json` means adding a hook there auto-checks it |
| Project structure | `.claude/settings.json` exists with expected configuration |
| Workspace shell | `.claude/` + `aidlc/spaces/default/memory/` are present (the shipped shell) |
| State file | the active intent's `aidlc-state.md` matches its audit trail (no drift) |
| Hook heartbeats | `.aidlc-hooks-health/` contains recent timestamps from hook executions |
| Graph integrity | No cycles in `stage-graph.json`; every slug has a matching stage file |
| Scope validation | All 9 scopes walk cleanly against the graph (advisories for scope-truncation gaps are expected) |
| Schema + references | Every stage's YAML frontmatter validates, and every consumes/requires_stage reference resolves |
| Keyword overlap | No keyword is claimed by more than one scope across the `.claude/scopes/*.md` files |
| Pending-compose marker | Reports a present `aidlc/.aidlc-compose-pending` (the in-flight compose gate marker) with its age. Fresh (under 24h, the normal state at an open compose gate) passes as advisory; stale (a crashed compose gate stranded it) fails. Silent when absent. Remediation: delete it if no compose gate is pending, or resolve the gate |

### Example output

```
✓ Installed runtime: active AI-DLC version is complete
✓ aidlc-audit-logger.ts present
✓ aidlc-sync-statusline.ts present
✓ aidlc-validate-state.ts present
✓ aidlc-log-subagent.ts present
✓ aidlc-session-start.ts present
✓ aidlc-session-end.ts present
✓ aidlc-statusline.ts present
✓ settings.json present
✓ AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE (unset — no project default)
✓ workspace shell ready (.claude/ + aidlc/spaces/default/memory/)
✓ Hook heartbeats: not yet fired (first workflow stage will populate)
✓ State matches last audit event (no drift)
✓ Cycle detection: 0 cycles
✓ Orphan stage files: 32 graph entries all have files
✓ Scope validation: 9 scopes valid (29 advisories)
✓ Schema validation: 32/32 stages valid
✓ Graph references: 122 artifacts + edges resolved
✓ Keyword overlap: no conflicts
```

### Fixing failures

| Failure | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `aidlc` not found | Add the installer-reported bin directory to PATH, then open a new shell |
| Hook not present | Run `aidlc init --dry-run`, then `aidlc init` to refresh the projection |
| `settings.json` missing | Run `aidlc init` to restore the selected harness projection |
| Workspace shell missing | Run `aidlc init` to restore the project shell |
| State file issues | Archive the active intent's record dir under `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/` and run `/aidlc` to start fresh |
| Graph/scope/schema/keyword failures | The diagnostic names the artifact, slug, or scope at fault. Refresh released content with `aidlc init`; framework developers can regenerate authored changes with `aidlc __delegate graph compile`. |

## Start Your First Workflow

Once `--doctor` passes, you are ready to run:

```
/aidlc Build a REST API for inventory management
```

Or specify a scope directly:

```
/aidlc feature
/aidlc bugfix Fix the login timeout issue
```

See [Your First Workflow](02-your-first-workflow.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough of what happens next.

## Quick Reference

In your shell:

```bash
# Verify prerequisites
command -v claude >/dev/null && echo "✓ Claude Code" || echo "✗ Claude Code"
command -v aidlc  >/dev/null && echo "✓ aidlc"        || echo "✗ aidlc"

# Initialize, verify, and launch
cd your-project
aidlc init
aidlc doctor
claude
```

Inside the Claude Code session:

```
# Verify (exits 1 on any check failure; read stdout for the full report)
/aidlc --doctor

# Start
/aidlc Build a task management API with user authentication
```

## Tool Permissions

The included `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves the standard non-shell tools
and the native `aidlc` command prefix. Review this file before use and adjust
it to your security requirements.

See [Customization](13-customization.md) for details on modifying tool permissions.
