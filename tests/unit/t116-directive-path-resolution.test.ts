// CLI-contract port of tests/unit/t116-directive-path-resolution.sh (TAP plan
// 13), mechanism = cli. The .sh exercises the engine's run-stage directive
// builder's artifact-path RESOLUTION: it resolves the graph node's artifact
// VOCABULARY NAMES (produces = bare names; consumes = {artifact, required,
// conditional_on} objects) into canonical aidlc-docs/... paths at emit time,
// and drops conditional_on consumes-entries against the workflow's Project Type.
//   - produces resolve under the directive's OWN stage (the node IS the producer).
//   - consumes resolve under their PRODUCING stage (a consumed artifact lives in
//     the dir of the one stage that produces it — docs/reference/
//     16-artifact-vocabulary.md:20-24, 44-48 — not the consuming stage's dir).
//   - per-unit Construction stages (for_each: unit-of-work) inject a {unit-name}
//     segment, applied to whichever stage OWNS the file.
//
// Source under test (dist/claude/.claude/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts):
//   :619 resolveArtifactPath(name, owner, unit)
//          - non-per-unit: aidlc-docs/<owner.phase>/<owner.slug>/<name>.md
//          - per-unit:     aidlc-docs/construction/<unit>/<owner.slug>/<name>.md
//   :639 resolveConsumePath(name, node, unit) — keys on producersOf(name)[0],
//          NOT the consuming node (1:1 producer rule); orphan fallback to node.
//   :651 projectTypeFrom(stateContent) — reads "Project Type", lowercased to
//          "brownfield" | "greenfield" | null.
//   :670 resolveConsumes(consumes, node, projectType, unit) — drops a consume
//          whose conditional_on != projectType (when projectType is non-null).
//   :692 resolveProduces(node, unit) — every produces name resolves (no filter).
//   :742 buildRunStageDirective(...) — assembles the directive with the resolved
//          consumes[]/produces[] arrays.
// NONE of these are exported (the tool has zero `export`s — verified), so the
// resolution is only observable on the directive the spawned engine emits to
// stdout. MECHANISM = cli: SPAWN the real `bun aidlc-orchestrate.ts next` via
// node:child_process spawnSync (BUN + the .ts path) and assert on the parsed
// JSON directive's produces[]/consumes[] arrays — the same process boundary the
// .sh drove (`bun "$TOOL" next ... 2>&1` then python-parsed the JSON). An
// in-process twin is IMPOSSIBLE here: the functions are unreachable from TS.
//
// VEHICLE (mirrors the .sh's emit_for, t116:51-63): a WITH-STATE jump now emits
// a `print` naming aidlc-jump.ts execute (NOT a run-stage; pinned by t114/t117/
// t118), so the path-resolution behaviour is reached via the Branch-10 happy
// path — seed a fixture, pivot Current Stage to the target slug AND mark its
// checkbox in-flight ([-]), then run bare `next`. That emits a run-stage for the
// in-flight stage with produces/consumes resolved. Scope MUST be one where the
// target EXECUTEs (feature scope does for domain-design/functional-design/
// code-generation). Project Type drives the conditional_on filter and is read
// from the fixture:
//   brownfield = state-brownfield-feature.md (Brownfield, feature)
//   greenfield = state-construction.md       (Greenfield, feature)
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1, every .sh assertion -> a named test();
// several STRONGER via exact path equality, exact produces COUNT, and the
// no-self-key directive-wide invariant rather than a single substring grep):
//   .sh test 1  (BF produces 'components' path)             -> "1: brownfield ..."
//   .sh test 2  (BF produces 'decisions' path)              -> "2: brownfield ..."
//   .sh test 3  (BF resolves all 5 produces)                -> "3: brownfield ..."
//   .sh test 4  (BF consume 'architecture' under producer)  -> "4: brownfield ..."
//   .sh test 5  (BF consume 'component-inventory' under prod)-> "5: brownfield ..."
//   .sh test 6  (GF drops conditional 'architecture')        -> "6: greenfield ..."
//   .sh test 7  (GF drops conditional 'component-inventory')-> "7: greenfield ..."
//   .sh test 8  (GF non-conditional produces still resolves)-> "8: greenfield ..."
//   .sh test 9  (per-unit functional-design {unit-name})    -> "9: per-unit ..."
//   .sh test 10 (per-unit code-generation {unit-name})      -> "10: per-unit ..."
//   .sh test 11 (non-per-unit app-design NO {unit-name})    -> "11: non-per-unit ..."
//   .sh test 12 (consume 'requirements' under its producer) -> "12: ..."
//   .sh test 13 (NO consume under app-design's own dir)     -> "13: ..."
//
// FIXTURE DISCIPLINE (mirrors create_test_project + seed_state_file + the in-place
// sed pivots + cleanup_test_project per emit): each emit uses a FRESH temp project
// dir (createTestProject, toPortablePath on Windows so any path the tool
// round-trips through JSON survives). seedStateFile copies the named fixture to
// aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md, then sedReplaceInFile pivots Current Stage to the
// target and flips its checkbox to [-]. All temp dirs cleaned in afterAll.
// resetAidlcEnv() clears AWS_AIDLC_DEFAULT_SCOPE so a developer's exported value
// can't shadow the fixture scope. Each fixture is emitted ONCE and the directive
// reused across its tests (the .sh emitted BF/GF/FD/CG once each too).
