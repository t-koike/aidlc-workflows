//
// t01 — shipped-tree file-structure invariant. Migrated from
// tests/smoke/t01-file-structure.sh (TAP plan 63, 63 distinct file-existence
// assertions). The .sh resolved CLAUDE_DIR = dist/claude/.claude and ran
// assert_file_exists on each of the 63 paths the framework ships.
//
// Mechanism: none. This is a pure structural check — does each shipped path
// exist on disk under the distributable .claude/ tree? No process boundary, no
// argv/exit/stdout seam, no LLM, zero tokens. We resolve the same tree the .sh
// resolved via the harness's AIDLC_SRC (= <repo>/dist/claude/.claude,
// fixtures.ts:42) and assert existsSync() in-process. AIDLC_SRC is the TS
// canonical for the .sh's `cd .../dist/claude/.claude && pwd` CLAUDE_DIR.
//
// Subject under test: the shipped layout of dist/claude/.claude/ — the bytes a
// user copies into their project's .claude/. Verified present on disk this
// session (every path below `ls`-confirmed against the worktree's dist tree).
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1, every .sh assertion preserved; counts are
// STRONGER than the .sh, which only existence-checked each path individually):
//   .sh L12  SKILL.md exists                          -> "ships skills/aidlc/SKILL.md"
//   .sh L15-17  3 stage-protocol files                -> "ships the 3 stage-protocol spine files" (each asserted)
//   .sh L20-29  10 hooks (each)                        -> "ships each of the 10 framework hooks" + "ships EXACTLY the 10 expected aidlc-*.ts hooks" (count strengthening)
//   .sh L32-34  11 agents (loop)                       -> "ships each of the 13 domain-expert agent personas" + "ships EXACTLY 13 aidlc-*-agent.md files" (count strengthening; roster grew to 13 with the two reviewer personas)
//   .sh L38-40  3 initialization stages (loop)         -> "ships the 3 initialization stages"
//   .sh L43-45  7 ideation stages (loop)               -> "ships the 7 ideation stages"
//   .sh L48-50  8 inception stages (loop)              -> "ships the 8 inception stages"

//   .sh L58-60  7 operation stages (loop)              -> "ships the 7 operation stages"
//   .sh (all stages)                                   -> "ships EXACTLY 32 stage files across the 5 phases" (count strengthening)
//   .sh L63-64  settings.json + settings.local.json.example -> "ships settings.json and settings.local.json.example"
//   .sh L67  state-template.md                          -> "ships knowledge/aidlc-shared/state-template.md"
//   .sh L70-71  org + project rules                     -> "ships the org and project rule layers"
//   .sh L74  CLAUDE.md                                  -> "ships the user-facing CLAUDE.md"
