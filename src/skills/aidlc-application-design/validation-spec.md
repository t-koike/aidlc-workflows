# Application Design — Validation Spec

## Inputs

- Artifacts (always-on): `components.md`, `component-methods.md`, `component-dependencies.md`, `services.md`, `cross-cutting.md`
- Artifacts (conditional, if present): `data-models.md`, `api-contracts.md`, `event-catalog.md`, `external-dependencies.md`
- Answered question file: `application-design-questions.md`
- Upstream: `requirements.md`, `stories.md`, `personas.md`
- Upstream (if present): `screen-data-map.md`

## Rules

1. All four always-on artifacts (`components.md`, `component-methods.md`, `component-dependencies.md`, `services.md`) and `cross-cutting.md` must be present and non-empty.
2. Conditional artifacts must be present when applicable: `data-models.md` if persistence exists, `api-contracts.md` if the system exposes APIs, `event-catalog.md` if the system is event-driven, `external-dependencies.md` if external integrations exist. If a conditional artifact is omitted, the reason must be stated in `components.md`.
3. Every component in `components.md` must appear in `component-methods.md` with at least one method and in `component-dependencies.md`.
4. Every service in `services.md` must reference at least one component from `components.md`.
5. Every story in `stories.md` must be addressable by at least one service, component, API, or event. Any unmapped story must be flagged with a reason.
6. Every entity in `data-models.md` must have exactly one owning component listed in `components.md`. No two components may own the same entity.
7. Every API in `api-contracts.md` must use the error format defined in `cross-cutting.md`.
8. Every event in `event-catalog.md` must have at least one producer and at least one consumer mapped to components, services, or external systems.
9. Every external dependency in `external-dependencies.md` must have at least one consumer mapped to a component or service.
10. All artifacts describe logical behaviour — no language, framework, database, protocol, broker, or vendor specifics.
11. Circular dependencies between components must be listed in `component-dependencies.md` with explicit justification.
12. If `screen-data-map.md` is present, every data field it references must be providable by at least one component, service, or API in the design. Any screen data need that cannot be served by the current design must be flagged.
