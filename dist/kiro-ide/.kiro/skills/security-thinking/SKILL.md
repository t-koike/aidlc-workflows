# Security Thinking

## Purpose

The ability to identify threats, classify data sensitivity, recognize trust boundaries, and ensure security considerations are embedded in whatever artifact is being produced or reviewed.

## Principles

- Identify assets — what data or capabilities are worth protecting? Classify by sensitivity (public, internal, confidential, restricted)
- Identify threats — what could go wrong? Which OWASP Top 10 categories apply?
- Define controls — for each threat, what mitigates it?
- Mark trust boundaries — where does data cross trust levels? What validation happens at each crossing?
- Consider failure modes — does the system fail open (dangerous) or fail closed (safe)?
- Preserve auditability — can security-relevant actions be traced?

## Definitions

- **Trust boundary** — a point where data crosses between zones of different trust levels
- **Data classification** — public (no harm if disclosed), internal (low impact), confidential (material harm), restricted (highest sensitivity — PII, credentials, financial, health)
- **Attack surface** — the sum of all points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data
- **Defence in depth** — multiple layers of controls; no single point of failure

## Application

When applied at requirements-analysis: ensure security-relevant capabilities are captured as requirements, sensitive data types are identified with at least high-level classification, and compliance obligations are stated.

When applied at application-design: identify trust boundaries between components, flag unprotected data flows, ensure auth enforcement points are defined.

When applied at code-generation: verify parameterized queries, output encoding, CSRF protection, secure headers, secrets management patterns are followed.

When applied at any stage: flag artifacts that introduce unclassified data flows, store credentials in plaintext, or lack audit trail coverage for security events.
