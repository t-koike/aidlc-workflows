# Domain Design

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

Identify and detail the **logical building blocks** of the system — the components you will write code for. A component is a bounded piece of software with its own business logic, entities, and lifecycle: **code you write, not infrastructure you deploy.** Databases, caches, queues, and third-party services are dependencies OF components, not components themselves.

This stage does NOT decide deployment topology (monolith, microservices, serverless, etc.) — that is Units Generation's job. Domain Design produces the building blocks so the team can then decide how to group them into deployable units. It also does not choose the tech stack or NFR patterns — those belong to the NFR and infrastructure stages.

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Agent Personas

Load aidlc-architect-agent persona from `agents/aidlc-architect-agent.md` and knowledge from `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/knowledge/aidlc-architect-agent/`.
Load aidlc-aws-platform-agent persona from `agents/aidlc-aws-platform-agent.md` and knowledge from `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/knowledge/aidlc-aws-platform-agent/` for dependency-service awareness (a component may depend on a managed service — that dependency is captured, but the service itself is not a component).
Load aidlc-design-agent persona from `agents/aidlc-design-agent.md` and knowledge from `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/knowledge/aidlc-design-agent/` for UI component specifications and UX-informed design constraints.

### Step 2: Load Prior Context

- Read `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md`
- Read `<record>/inception/user-stories/stories.md` (if produced)
- If brownfield: Read relevant RE artifacts (especially architecture.md, component-inventory.md, dependencies.md)

### Step 3: Create Design Plan with Questions

Create `<record>/inception/domain-design/domain-design-questions.md` with context-appropriate questions using [Answer]: tag format:
- Component boundary decisions (what is a distinct building block, and why)
- Entity ownership (each entity has exactly one owning component — ambiguity is a design smell)
- Component responsibilities (what business logic each block owns)
- Interaction between components (which component calls which, and why)
- Integration approach with existing components (brownfield)
- UI component structure (if user-facing, informed by UX designer perspective)

### Step 4: Collect and Analyze Answers

Collect answers following stage-protocol.md §3 question flow (offer interaction mode choice, collect answers, write back to file).
- MANDATORY ambiguity analysis: scan for vague language, contradictions, missing details
- Create follow-up questions if ANY ambiguity found
- Resolve all ambiguities before proceeding

### Step 5: Generate the Component Catalogue

Create `<record>/inception/domain-design/components.md`. This single artifact carries both a machine-readable catalogue and the human-readable view.

**Part A — machine-readable catalogue (fenced `yaml` block).** Author a fenced ```yaml block near the top of the file listing every component. This block is the source of truth; the human view below is derived from it. Each component carries a behaviour description, its dependencies (components it calls) and dependent components (components that call it), and the entities it owns with their attributes:

```yaml
components:
  - name: <ComponentName>
    behaviour: <what this component does — business rules, validation, security constraints, key behaviours; be specific>
    depends_on:
      - component: <component it calls>
        interaction: <why and what for>
    dependents:
      - component: <component that calls this one>
        interaction: <why and what for>
    entities:
      - name: <EntityName>
        attributes: [<attribute-name>, <attribute-name>]
  - name: <AnotherComponent>
    behaviour: <...>
    depends_on: []
    dependents: []
    entities:
      - name: <EntityName>
        attributes: [<attribute-name>]
```

Rules for the block: name each component exactly once; every `component:` named in a `depends_on`/`dependents` list must be a declared component; a component may not depend on itself; every entity has exactly one owning component (no entity appears under two components).

**Part B — human-readable view (below the block).** Derive these sections from the catalogue — same data, presented for humans:

- **Component Diagram** — a `mermaid` diagram showing which components call which, with labelled edges.
- **Component Summary** — a table: `| Component | Purpose | Dependencies | Entities Owned |`.
- **Rationale** — a table explaining why each component is a separate building block (distinct lifecycle, distinct concern, distinct data ownership, distinct change rate — pick what applies).

#### Component-boundary options (when >1 viable decomposition)

When a decomposition choice has more than one viable approach, present the
trade-off before recording the decision:

- Option A — <name>: pros / cons / reversibility
- Option B — <name>: pros / cons / reversibility
- Recommendation: <option> because <trade-off tied to responsibilities/change rate>

The team chooses at the gate (ownership stays with the team), then record the
chosen decomposition plus an **Alternatives Rejected** note in the Rationale
section of components.md.

When only one decomposition is viable, state why and skip the block.

### Step 6: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun {{HARNESS_DIR}}/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts report --stage domain-design --result <outcome>`.
The engine owns all lifecycle transitions and advancement.

### Step 7: Present Completion & Request Approval

Use stage-protocol.md completion template with completion emoji: :building_construction:
- Summary of components identified (count, key boundaries, entity ownership)
- Key boundary decisions highlighted
- Review path: `<record>/inception/domain-design/`
- Structured approval question with options:
  - Approve (continue to next stage)
  - Request Changes (provide revision feedback)
  - Add Units Generation (if it was skipped in execution plan)

If "Add Units Generation" is selected, run
`bun {{HARNESS_DIR}}/tools/aidlc-utility.ts recompose --add units-generation`
before re-entering the approval flow.

## Sensors

This stage's output is a markdown artefact under `<record>/inception/domain-design/`.

The imported sensors check that output:

- **`required-sections`** verifies the output contains the registry default (≥2 H2 headings). Failure mode: missing headings emit `SENSOR_FAILED` with detail at `<record>/.aidlc-sensors/<stage-slug>/required-sections-<iso>.md`.
- **`upstream-coverage`** verifies the output prose references each artefact declared in this stage's `consumes:` frontmatter. Failure mode: missing upstream references emit `SENSOR_FAILED` listing each unreferenced artefact (this stage consumes `requirements`, `stories`, `team-practices`).

## Learn

While running this stage, maintain a running log in
`<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md` (create on stage start if absent).
Append entries under four standard headings:

- **Interpretations** — choices made where the stage prose was ambiguous
- **Deviations** — places you intentionally departed from the stage prose, and why
- **Tradeoffs** — alternatives considered and why you picked what you did
- **Open questions** — anything to confirm before next run, or uncertain context

Format each entry with an ISO 8601 timestamp:
`- 2026-05-20T10:14:32Z — <summary>; <context>`

Before the approval gate, read memory.md and surface candidates as a
structured question. For each entry the user keeps, write to the appropriate
harness destination per `stage-protocol.md` §13 — never to this stage file:

- Prescriptive rule → a practice line under the routed heading in
  `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/project.md` (default) or `team.md` (promoted)
- Verification check → new manifest at `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/sensors/aidlc-<id>.md`
  (capability descriptor only — no `applies_to`); add the new id to
  the relevant stage's `sensors: [...]` frontmatter list to wire it

Even when nothing surfaces, still ask the mandatory "Anything to add for next time?" question from stage-protocol.md section 13. Do not infer "Nothing to add." Only after the human answers that question may you proceed to the gate. The memory.md
file stays in the artefact directory as part of the stage's permanent record.

Stage files are immutable framework artefacts — the ritual writes into the
harness, not into this file. Next time this stage runs, the new rules and
sensors load automatically.
